**Abstract**
: The Mineralogy extension is a standardized lexicon developed by the Mineralogy Extension Task Group to improve the distribution of information pertaining to mineralogy collections. The expansion comprises a compilation of knowledge organization resources, focused on the normative term list, incorporating support for the Compound Specimen Model, various classification systems, and an expanded array of geologic contexts.

## 1 Introduction <span id="1-introduction"><span>
### 1.1 Status of the content of this document <span id="11-status-of-the-content-of-this-document"></span>
Sections 2 through 3 are normative, except for Table 1. In Section 4 and its subparts, the values of the Normative IRI, 
Definition, Required, and Repeatable are normative. The value of Usage (if it exists for a given term) is normative in 
that it specifies how a borrowed term should be used as part of Latimer Core. The values of Term Name is non-normative, 
although one can expect that the namespace abbreviation prefix is one commonly used for the term namespace. Labels and 
the values of all other properties (such as notes) are non-normative.

### 1.2 RFC 2119 key words <span id="12-rfc-2119-key-words"></span>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", 
and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### 1.3 Categories of terms <span id="13-categories-of-terms"></span>

## 2 Borrowed Vocabulary <span id="2-borrowed-vocabulary"></span>

Table 1. Vocabularies from which terms have been borrowed (non-normative)
| Vocabulary | Abbreviation | Namespaces and abbreviations |
|------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/) | DwC         | `dwc: = http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/`
| [Darwin Core Chronometric Age Vocabulary](https://tdwg.github.io/chrono/) | Chrono         | `chrono: = http://rs.tdwg.org/chrono/terms/`

## 3 Namespaces, Prefixes and Term Names <span id="3-namespace-prefixes-term-names"></span>
The namespace of terms borrowed from other vocabularies is that of the original. The namespace of de novo Mineralogy Extension 
terms is http://rs.tdwg.org/mineralogy/terms/.  In the table of terms, each term entry has a row with the term name. This term  name is generally an “unqualified name” preceded by a widely accepted prefix designating  an abbreviation for the namespace It is RECOMMENDED that implementers who need a namespace  prefix for the MinExt namespace use minext. In this web document, hovering over a term in the [Index By Term Name](https://ltc.tdwg.org/termlist/#index-by-term-name) list below will reveal a complete URL that can be used in other web documents to link to this document’s  treatment of that term, even if it is from a borrowed vocabulary. It is very important to note that some  vocabularies, e.g those of the [Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)](http://dublincore.org/), provide versions of the  same term in two different namespaces, one providing for string values and one providing for IRIs,  even where that separation is simply a recommendation, not a mandate.
